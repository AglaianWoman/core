- **Http interface**: WIP :grey_exclamation:
    Serps is built in a way you can use any http client 
    of your convenience, but offering a default client 
    with a common interface will make its usage much 
    more robust and easy. At the current 
    stats we are evaluing the usage of [Httplug](http://httplug.io/)
    that is still in alpha.
